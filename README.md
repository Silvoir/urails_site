# Installation
This is a simple rails app, and to get it running, I recommend following this proceedure

1. Git clone the app to a directory you want, and navigate to said directory
2. `bundle install` to get the dependencies
3. `rake db:setup` to get the databases set up and populated
4. `rake db:migrate` as a precaution
5. `rails server`
